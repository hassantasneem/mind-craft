# MINDCRAFT - Quiz Game
This repository contains the source code for mindcraft, a quiz game developed as a part of our end semester project at FAST-NUCES

## Team
1) Muhammad Hassan Tasneem
2) Syed Muhammad Ali
3) Mahad Itqaan Naser

## Project Overview:
The game allows users to test their general knowledge across multiple categories (e.g. Geography, IQ, History) with varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). The goal of this project was to create a scalable game capable of handling diverse question sets and providing an engaging user experience.

## Key Features:

1) Multiple Categories: Wide range of topics available.
2) Varying Difficulty: Dynamic question selection based on user-chosen difficulty.


This project serves as a showcase of our ability to deliver a complex, feature-complete game using purely C++.
